Human PBMC Annotation References

Description:
- References were built from Fluent internal datasets using frozen PBMCs obtained from AllCells
- References are based on cell types identified via Azimuth (https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/#Human%20-%20PBMC)

Files:
1. metadata.csv
	- List of cell types and naming information differences across references

2. human-pbmc-v3.csv
	- Reference designed based on expression profile consistent with the PIPseq v3 chemistry.

3. human-pbmc-v4.csv
	- Reference designed based on PIPseq v4 chemistry expression profile. The v4 chemistry captured more consistent profiles and additional cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

4. human-pbmc-v4-detailed.csv
	- Reference designed based on PIPseq v4 chemistry, but expanded to include more refined cell types. Distinctions are made between different cell subtypes, including T cells and conventional dendritic cells. A high mitochondrial cell type was also included to capture clusters with lower quality cells.
